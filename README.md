# Eventfull-Playground

Nothing that much interesting here... Just experimentation with [eventful](https://github.com/jdreaver/eventful).


# Install

With haskell-stack installed on your machine:

```
$ stack build
```

and wait...

# Running program

So far this is just dummy counter that can be incremented and decremented. State is stored in memmory.

```
$ stack exec eventfull-playground-exe
```

then pass series of commands `+` / `-` / `=` followed by enter to alter state of the program.
